# Valencia White âœ¨
Hey, welcome to my profile! My developer's path is supplemented by my background knowledge in Graphic Design and Interior Design. I belive the purpose of great code is to go hand-in-hand with great design, in order to create a refined user experience worth remembering. 

- Currently learning Ruby.
- I write articles on what I learn on Dev.to . I mostly cover Html, CSS, JavaScript, and Design topics. 
- Besides coding, I'm passionate about  Capoeira, "human-language" language learning, and b-horror films!
    - Current Language Interests:  Portuguese 
- She/Her
