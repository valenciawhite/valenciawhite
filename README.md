Hey, welcome to my profile! My developer's path is supplemented by my background knowledge in Graphic Design and Interior Design. I belive the purpose of great code is to go hand-in-hand with great design, in order to create a refined user experience worth remembering. 

- Professionally  working in, JavaScript/React and C#.
- Besides coding, I'm passionate about  art/design, "human-language" language learning, and gardening!
